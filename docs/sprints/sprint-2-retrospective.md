## Challenges & Blockers 🚧

1. **Contributor Dashboard Incomplete**
   - **Problem:** Edit post flow more complex than estimated
   - **Impact:** Story 4 partially complete, moved to Sprint 3
   - **Root Cause:** Underestimated permission complexity

2. **Template Inheritance Refactoring**
   - **Problem:** Base template needed restructuring mid-sprint
   - **Impact:** Delayed other template work by ~6 hours
   - **Root Cause:** Initial template structure not fully planned
   - **Action Item:** Template architecture review (Owner: adorable-crow, Due: Sprint 3 Day 1)

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - **Problem:** Some view edge cases not tested
   - **Impact:** Potential bugs in production
   - **Root Cause:** Focus on feature delivery over testing
   - **Action Item:** Increase test coverage to 80%+ (Owner: All, Due: Ongoing)

## Learnings 📚

1. **Bootstrap Benefits**
   - Significantly faster UI development
